# 📊 Eurasia Investment Portfolio Optimization

## 🧠 Overview
This project implements a **multi-asset portfolio optimization** and **risk simulation** model using Python. It was developed for the **Eurasia Asset Management Challenge**, where the goal was to create a robust 20-year strategic asset allocation plan across global ETFs using quantitative methods and sustainability-focused constraints.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Optimizes portfolio weights to meet a 10% annualized return target  
- ✅ Applies real-world constraints:  
  - ≥ 65% allocation to favored ETFs  
  - Fixed 5% Gold and 2.5% Cash allocations  
- ✅ Uses historical return and volatility assumptions for 18 ETFs  
- ✅ Performs **Monte Carlo simulations** (10,000 runs) over a 20-year period  
- ✅ Outputs portfolio return, volatility, and drawdown distributions  
- ✅ Visualizes results with clear histograms for:
  - End portfolio values  
  - Annualized returns  
  - Annualized volatility  
  - Maximum drawdowns

## 📈 Sample Output
Sample portfolio weights:
```
Invesco QQQ Trust: 9.20%
iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF: 7.34%
Vanguard Total International Bond ETF: 4.56%
...
Gold: 5.00%
Cash: 2.50%
```

Example metrics:
- **Expected Annualized Return**: ~10.5%  
- **Volatility**: ~18.2%  
- **Mean Ending Value**: ~$330 million (from initial $100M)  
- **Mean Max Drawdown**: ~25.4%
